"Show off Python" Friday rules
=============
by Sony Valdez

- Every Friday, we post something we created that uses Python. We can post code snippet, an article, working software or even your success story on Python.

- You show off your work. Even though its not as perfect as you want it to be, you show it off. Don't mind how impressive you think other's work are compared to yours, show it off.

- The idea for this weekly event to have something to focus on to improve your coding and/or writing skills.

- Hashtag your post with #ShowOffFridays

- Post constructive criticism when commenting on someone's "show off". Otherwise they will stop showing off and we don't want that.

- Philippines Python might make a blog in the future containing the different "Show Off Friday" entries. We would contact you first and ask for permission before posting on the blog. If you don't want to be included in the blog but still wish to show off every Friday, we will respect that. 

- Don't be shy. We don't bite.

- Don't panic.
